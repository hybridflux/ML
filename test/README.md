# Machine Learning useful things 
This is a collection of scripts and useful tools that facilitated my Machine Learning journey. 

The template [Image Classification using CNTK](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/preview/scenario-image-classification-using-cntk) in the Machine Learning workbench can be a useful first step in getting to use CNTK for Visual Object classification. However, the current version (02/2018) only allows to evaluate the model with either a split of the picture set for training/test. The code was written during a Microsoft Machine Learning OpenHack to be able to evaluate a trained Model with pictures in a separate folder, as this was the part of the challenge. Details can be found in [the folder ImageClassificationCNTK](ImageClassificationCNTK/).
